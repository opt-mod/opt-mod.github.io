Shared-Vehicle Mobility-On-Demand Systems: Modeling and Optimization of Rebalancing Empty Vehicles over Hub-based Network  

> **Abstract.** In this project, we consider the operation of automated mobility-on-demand systems. where the mobility service of self-driving automated vehicles are shared by customers across different time. In this systems, redirecting after-service fleet to periodically match the upcoming demand plays an important role to guarantee service level as well as fleet utilization. Specifically, we approach this problem with a hub-based network model, where demand and traffic flow are generated with some pre-known demographic information. We track the fleet level at each hubs across different time period and come up with optimal rebalancing solution to redirect empty fleets using some key performance metrics, such as aggregated rebalancing travel time. Via simulation, we provide performance evaluation by comparing different rebalancing policies with different fleet size. We found that rebalancing benefits the system most when certain information of the future demand could be predicted.
